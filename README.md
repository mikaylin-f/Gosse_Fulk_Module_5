# Gosse_Fulk_Module_5

First uploaded the html to the repository
then downloaded the html and added back into twine to edit it.
We each took turns editing the twine and readding it back to GitHub by pushing and pulling the html file. 
We thought how we had to use both the desktop app and the web browser was very confusing.

When Jennifer went to upload the final twine, there was an error that prevented from pulling the file. To fix this Jennifer was able to redo the update on twine and resubmit for the pull and it fixed itself!
